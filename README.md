# Purpose
This application is created to serve football news from popular teams. Clients can subscribe to different clubs and
receive push notifications when news are scraped, by registering to a webook.

# Motivation
I find myself regularly checking my favorite teams website to see if there are new articles, which might as well be
automated. The intention is to create a Firefox Browser extension to serve as front end. As I usually have my browser
open this seems like a good way to keep up to date without much effort.

Additionally, I wanted to try out Python since I have mostly worked in c# before. Python seems like a great language to 
learn as it is very versatile and simplistic in its syntax. 

# TODO
Here is a list of features I would like to implement in the future:
1. Provide data about upcoming matches for clubs the client subscribe to.
2. Provide basic team data like statistics and squad lists.
